Revision history for Perl extension Geo::RasterAlgebra, formerly (Grid).

0.01  Sun Nov 14 02:10:07 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
      Wed Dec 21 18:20    1999
	- published on http://www.water.hut.fi/pub/Grid and announced
          in comp.infosystems.gis and comp.lang.perl.modules
0.02  Wed Jan 26 10:12:05 EET 2000
        - started the new version
      Wed Feb 16 14:20:27 EET 2000
       	- corrected a bug in subwatersheds
	- logical operations
        - mathematical operations
          this breaks
		$gd->log10();
          which was introduced in 0.01, either use
         	&Grid::gdlog10($gd->{GRID});
          or 
		$gd = $gd->log10();
	- neighbors
	- colored_map
	- if ... then construct for grids as a subroutine
	- print(nonzeros=>1) prints now lines of i,j,x (also alias dump())
	- restore method can be used to restore from data files
	  created by dump
	- lots of work in watershed.*
	- new constructor $b = new Grid (like=>$a);
	- methods min and max return the min and max of the grid if
 	  called without parameter (with parameter returns a grid)

0.03  Mon Mar 13 10:02:40 EET 2000
	- started the development of version 0.03
      Tue Mar 14 09:42:05 EET 2000
	- fixed the cellmove bug in watershed.c
	- published
0.04  Tue Mar 14 09:42:05 EET 2000
	- started the development of version 0.04
	- border() methods :: there may be a bug in recursive method?
	- fixcrossings-method for flow direction grids
	- changes after reading Object Oriented Perl by Conway: 
	- use constant *_GRID
	- operator overloading, including built-in functions and
          taking care of reversed order
	- in_place versions of many methods, if no result is required,
          the method is in_place
	- math functions: $a->sin(); is in_place $a = $a->sin();
          creates a temporary copy
	- attributes M and N are now stored also in the self-hash
	- movecell, ups
	- changes, additions and bugfixes to watershed.c
	- published Tue Apr 11 09:46:18 EEST 2000
0.05 Tue Apr 11 09:46:18 EEST 2000
	- added attribute name
	- added database handle and database methods
	- published May 23 15:08
0.06 Tue May 23 15:24:30 EEST 2000
	- work on colortable, it is getting useful now
	- filled circles and a gis method based on that: bufferzone
	- a (bad) interpolation method, nearest neighbor
	- method 'function' which fills the grid using an
          arbitrary function of x an y --- Perl at its best!
	- work on the database interface
	- vector data, loading from database and simple visualization
	- Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation using an
	  external program, see the Readme file .. these are stored
	  as vector data in the database... but Voronoi diagram only
	  as linesegments instead of polygons :-(
	- many bugfixes, hopefully the map algebra stuff is now
	  pretty much ok
	- published Jun 20
0.07 Mon Jun 26 15:50:44 EEST 2000
	- added the licese files
0.08 Thu Jun 29 17:14:56 EEST 2000
	- distances and directions
	- fixed a couple of bugs
0.09 Wed Jan 10 15:56:22 EET 2001
	- scaling of axes is now optional in plot/view/draw_on
	- code cleanups
        - nodata value in grids
	- zonal functions, cross product of integer grids
	- more or less complete rewrite of the hydrological functions (catchment.*)
	- new default file format hdr/bil
	- Grid: contents of a real grid
	- united demo.pl into test.pl
	- shell.pl: output(), plot() [uses gnuplot]
0.10 released Mon Oct 15 11:20:03 EEST 2001
	- applytempl: default new_value =  1
	- applytempl: return value (if requested) is a new grid and not the count anymore
	- new and save have named parameters "filename"
	- name attribute is set to the filename given to new or save
	- import and export initiated if a recognized extension is detected in the filename
	- export (later import?) uses colortable if exporting to ppm
	- exporting to (later importing from?) other graphics formats via external programs
	- code review: nodata, math, 
	- added mask support
