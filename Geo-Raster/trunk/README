Geo-Raster
=======================

DESCRIPTION

Geo::Raster has two purposes/goals:

1) To be a general purpose tool for working with geospatial raster
data. This means "raster/map algebra" (overlaying and masking DEMs
(Digital Elevation Models), land-use rasters, etc), spatial analyses
(kriging, ...), extracting indices from the grids (histograms, ...),
etc.

2) To be a general purpose Perl/C tool for doing hydrologic and water
resources GIS work. This means watershed delineation, finding stream
networks, calculating indices (topographic index, ...), preparing data
for hydrologic models, developing spatially distributed hydrologic
modeling, etc.

The small script rash.pl uses Term::ReadLine and is used to implement
a simple but very useful environment for "doing raster algebra GIS
with Perl". The rash.pl can have a live connection to gnuplot and
Postgres (if invoked with option -a), this is on a basic level now,
for example histograms are simple to plot and rgb values for a grid
can be retrieved from a database.

Gtk2::Ex::Geo is a GUI (with a CLI capability) for Geo::Raster

INSTALLATION

To install, unzip and untar the archive. In the directory created type

perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
make install

Geo::Raster requires the Raster Algebra Library libral. libral
is at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libral>.

Required modules are ExtUtils::Depends, Statistics::Descriptive,
gdalconst, and gdal.

Documentation is in the module file and will be added onto
perllocal.pod as usual.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

array.c and array.h are taken from the Karl Glazebrook's PGPLOT
distribution.
