=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::Geo - The main module to use for geospatial applications

Gtk2::Ex::Geo is a namespace for modules, classes, and widgets for
geospatial applications. This package contains the modules:

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo

The main module to 'use'.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Canvas

A subclass of Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf. Constructs a pixbuf from a stack of
geospatial layer objects by calling the 'render' method for each
$layer. Embedded in Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Overlay.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Overlay

A subclass of Gtk2::ScrolledWindow. A canvas in a scrolled
window. Contains a list of layer objects. Functionality includes
redraw, support for selections (point, line, path, rectangle, polygon,
or many of them), zoom, pan, and conversion between event and world
(layer) coordinates.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Layer

The root class for geospatial layers. A geospatial layer is a
typically a subclass of a geospatial data (raster, vector features, or
something else) and of this class. The idea is that this class
contains visualization information (transparency, palette, colors,
symbology, label placement, etc) for the data. Contains many callbacks
that are fired as a result of user using context menu, making a
selection, etc. Uses layer dialogs.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::DialogMaster

A class which maintains a set of Glade dialogs taken from XML in DATA
section.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Dialogs

A subclass of Gtk2::Ex::Geo::DialogMaster. Contains dialogs for
Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Layer.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Glue

Typically a singleton class for an object, which manages a
Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Overlay widget, a Gtk2::TreeView widgets, and other
widgets of a geospatial application. The object also takes care of
popping up context menus and other things.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::History

Embedded in Gtk2::Ex::Geo::Glue. Input history a'la (at least
attempting) GNU history that is used by Glue object with Gtk2::Entry.

=head2 Gtk2::Ex::Geo::TreeDumper

From http://www.asofyet.org/muppet/software/gtk2-perl/treedumper.pl-txt
For inspecting layer and other objects.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The documentation of Gtk2::Ex::Geo is included into the source code in
doxygen(1) format. The documentation can be generated in HTML, LaTeX,
and other formats using the doxygen executable and the perl doxygen
filter(2).

The documentation is of this framework is available as a part of the
documentation for Geoinformatica(3).
