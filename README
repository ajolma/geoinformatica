ABOUT GEOINFORMATICA

Geoinformatica is a geospatial toolkit that builds on GDAL, Perl and
GTK+. The toolkit contains currently one C library (libral, gvl is a
beginnings of another), seven Perl modules (in fact sets of modules,
of which Geo::OGC::SymbologyEncoding is only a concept), geospatial
web service programs, and a simple graphical application.

CONFIGURATION

Geoinformatica has been ported to GNU/Linux and MS Windows (using
MinGW and msys).

Perl bindings), Perl and GTK+. In addition you will need pkg-config.

In addition the following packages are required or good to have
