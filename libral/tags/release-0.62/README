This is a library for raster algebra. This library is released
under the LGPL licence, see file "lesser.txt".

This library is a part of Geoinformatica. See

HISTORY

This library used to be the part written in C of my Grid.pm Perl
module. Grid.pm is now Geo::Raster and it requires this library.

PURPOSE

The basic purpose of this library is to be a backend for raster
algebra implementations in geospatial software. This library contains
also some support for vector data (computational geometry), e.g.,
rasterization and visualization. Furthermore, there are some
hydrology-related algorithms for analysing DEMs.

- I/O: GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/> is used for input. Output is still
do-it-yourself into the ESRI .hdr Labelled format (needs Geo::Raster
for the header file).

- Data types: libral grids (rasters) are integer or real
grids. ral/config.h defines the implementation data types via
RAL_INTEGER and RAL_REAL defines, they are by default short (two byte
int) and float (four byte real). This is not tested but the idea is
that it should be possible to change these according to what is
needed.

OTHER CODE FOR RASTER ALGEBRA / TERRAIN ANALYSIS

For raster algebra / terrain analysis there are a couple other
libraries, some of which are free.

PCRaster http://www.geog.uu.nl/pcraster.html 

RiverTools http://cires.colorado.edu/people/peckham.scott/RT.html

TAPES http://cres.anu.edu.au/software/tapes.html (regrettably not
there any more!)

TARDEM http://www.engineering.usu.edu/dtarb/tardem.html

TOPOG http://www.clw.csiro.au/topog/user/user.html 

TOPAZ http://grl.ars.usda.gov/topaz/TOPAZ1.HTM

OpenEV http://openev.sourceforge.net

This library aims to be free, easily available, comprehensive, and
interoperable.

NOTES ON THE CODE

config.h

Generated by configure but included in distribution for
not-configure-based builds (in those cases, you may need to edit
it). Defines HAVE_LIBPNG.  This is _not_ installed anywhere, it is
used only in build.

ral.h

The main header to include for using RAL.

msg.h

Things that are needed to build RAL but not a part of its API. Mainly
error messages.

ral/config.h

Configuration for the local build. Generated by configure but included
in distribution for not-configure-based builds (in those cases, you
may need to edit it). Defines RAL_INTEGER and RAL_REAL.

ral/hash.h

This is an almost general purpose hash library. It is used for example
in ral_grid.c. I'm not using glib's hash functions and that's a
conscious decision.

ral/vector.h

This is a simple vector library. The functions are mostly used in
rasterization and in visualization.

ral/grid.h

This defines the grid structure (a raster) and fundamental raster
algebra operations and some not so fundamental. 

ral/dem.h

Methods for raster DEMs and its derivatives.

ral/visual.h

Visualization attributes and tools.

ral/backend.h

Methods for rendering geospatial data onto various backends using
visualization attributes. Currently home-grown code for rendering onto
a gdk style pixbuf but will be changed to use Cairo.
