- improve the terrain analysis code

- remove ral_gdwrite and replace it with GDAL functions

- switch to swig

- make error reporting thread-safe

- write a general trace_border function and put it into grid.c, it
should use callbacks as borderwalk, but it should have options: use 4
or 8 connectivity; trace 4 or 8 connective border cells (8 is
available when 8 connectivity is used); trace the border clockwise or
anti-clockwise; trace the outer border or the inner border

- write a function (which uses the trace_border and) which returns the
vertices of the border optimally (not midpoints of straight lines)
